This github repository provides the prep files to replicate the quantitative analysis in the paper entitled, "Invite only: The prevalence of subgroups within a police department" published in Journal of Criminal Justice. Available here https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2024.102347

The repository includes two script files:

1.	ponet-inviteonly-01: This script prepares the data for analysis. It includes code to clean the survey data, construct relevant covariates, and generate the descriptive statistics and tables reported in the manuscript.
2.	ponet-inviteonly-02: This script estimates Autologistic Actor Attribute Models (ALAAMs) to assess whether officer attributes and network position shape their likelihood of being invited or not to a subgroup.

The data come from the Police Networks Project (PoNet), a multi-year study examining officers’ informal and workplace relationships. The invite-only analysis focuses on survey data from one U.S. police department. Officers The survey data contain anonymized information on officers’ self-reported work histories, relationships within the police department, misconduct histories, weapon use, attitudes toward policing, and demographics.
